    - Billing
 - Run / Start debugging
 
 # What it covers
 
 The code is based on the NServiceBus quickstart tutorial available for download at https://docs.particular.net/tutorials/quickstart/

 Both NServiceBus and MassTransit require contracts to be shared between producers and consumers, including the full namespace.

This code is modified to show the usage of a generic message as message contracts and avoid sharing libraries / common classes as contracts.
